# reliability-test-GUI
A MATLAB GUI created to parse, summarise and display impedance spectra from lifetime realibility experiments.

The GUI can display Bode and phase plots, allowing the user to easily analyse accumulating data from lifetime experiments. Changes in impedance and phase can be plotted for the duration of the experiment. The 'Print figure' function allows the displayed graph to be captured in a .fig file for further processing if required.
